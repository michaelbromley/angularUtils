# Angular Utilities

### No longer maintained
(20/04/2017) - I am no longer actively maintaining this project. I no longer use AngularJS in my own projects and do not have the time to dedicate to maintiaining this project as well as my other active open source projects. Thank you for your understanding.

---

I am working on a large-scale AngularJS-based project and I'll be extracting
any useful re-usable components that I make and putting them here.

I'm following the convention of the [Ng-Boilerplate] (https://github.com/ngbp/ngbp) project of bundling
all relevant code together, so that you should be able to simply copy the
directory of the component you want to use, and it will include unit tests
and any other dependencies.

This code is made available under the MIT license, so feel free to use any of these is your projects. If you find any of them useful I'd be happy to get feedback!
